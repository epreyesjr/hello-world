# hello-world
A practice session to create a repository
Hello there

Don't really know what I'm doing yet. Just trying out GitHub to see how it works.
I'm here in London. I arrived here yesterday afternoon with my wife Regan. We'll be 
traveling around the UK for about a month but the health authorities need to find out if 
we're infected with COVID before we're free to travel the country. We're looking forward to 
visiting Shetland and Orkneys.
